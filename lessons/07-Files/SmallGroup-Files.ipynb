    "# Now You Code In Class: Extracting Hyperlinks from a Webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a program which extracts the hyperlinks from a Webpage. There are 3 webpage files you can try with this program:\n",
    "\n",
    "    httpbin-org.html\n",
    "    ischool-directory.html\n",
    "    ist256-com.html\n",

    "Here's the basic strategy. We must read in the contents all at once since there is not line structure within the HTML.

    "\n",
    "- **absolute** links are URL's like `https://www.google.com`. These begin with `http://` or `https://`\n",
    "- **email** links like `mailto:president@whitehouse.gov`. This begin with `mailto:`\n",
    "- **bookmarks** are links to places on the same page. `#about`. These begin with `#`. \n",
    "- **relative** links (to pages on the same site). Consider all other links this type of link.\n",

It works by writing the alogrithm at a high level, then for each step in the algorithm which is non-trivial (more than a line of code) we write the step as its own function. We test the functions then assemble the final program code by calling the functions we made.\n",

    "    5.       determine link type\n",
    "    6.       print link and link type (external / internal / email / bookmark)\n",
