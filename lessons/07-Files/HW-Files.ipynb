    "    - Then re-write your program to use another mailbox like `enron-allen-inbox.txt` to make sure it prints multiple emails.\n",
    "    - Next re-write your program to omit any emails with the domain `enron.com`\n",
    "    - Next not only print the emails, but write them back out to the file: `enron-allen-emails.txt`\n",
    "    - Finally add the ipywidget drop-down where you can select a mailbox and save to a different `emails` file based on the `inbox` file name.\n"
